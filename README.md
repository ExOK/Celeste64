Fuji is a basic Mod Loader for <b>Celeste 64: Fragments of the Mountain</b>, a game made by the original Celeste developers in under 2 weeks for Celeste's 6th Anniversary. It is forked from the source code of that game.

Fuji is still very early in development, but is currently able to load custom levels alongside the main game, as well as loading additional assets such as custom models, custom dialog, custom textures, etc...
It also implements some new functionality like custom skins, and the ability to load code mods from DLLs.

# Installation
- [Download the latest release here according to your OS.](https://github.com/FujiAPI/Fuji/releases/latest)
- Unzip the project.
- Put your mods into the Mods folder that comes with Fuji.
- Open `Celeste64-Fuji` to start playing!

Fuji does not require the original game's files to run - it is a standalone client. Your vanilla Celeste 64 installation and Fuji installation(s) should not be mixed up.
